const aboutMe = `Hello my name is Michael, I am a graduate of information technology at  ${school}, My first job was as an admin officer in a local government. My task is to input all the necessary data that was filled by the customers. Eventually, I became a Customer Service Representative in a BPO company where stayed for 5 years.  I started working remotely in 2019 before the pandemic came. I was hired as a Customer service for a local flower shop when I got used to working remotely I tried to upskill and became a Virtual Assistant for Amazon.com as a product researcher. Luckily  I was hired and able to hone my skills and  earned experience  for 2 years of staying with my client. Due to my passion for web programming. Join me as I talk about my online bootcamp and how I'm applying my knowledge to become the best web developer that I can be. I am confident that my skills and experience in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js will be good fit for this position. I am hoping to be considered  Thank you!.`;
